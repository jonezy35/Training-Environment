# Building our DMSS kit sensor

### You must first follow the Linux-Setup SOP.

`sudo su`

### Building Zeek

Let us first pull the zeek source code from our repository (Don't forget the forward slash after zeek, otherwise it will pull the whole repo.dmss.lan page)

```
wget -r http://repo.dmss.lan/zeek/

cd zeek/
```
